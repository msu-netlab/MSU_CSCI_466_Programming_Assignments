# CSCI 466 Programming Assignment - Control Plane 

## Instructions


Complete the following assignment by yourself, or in a group of two.
Submit your work into the Dropbox on D2L into the “Programming Assignment 4” folder. 
All partners will submit the same solution and we will only grade one solution for each group.

## Learning Objectives

In this lab you will:

-   Design a control packet

-   Implement a distance-vector routing protocol

-   Control routing using link costs

## Overview

In this project, you will implement a distance-vector routing protocol on a router. 
Your task is to extend the given code to implement several router functions.

### Starting Code

The starting code for this project provides you with the implementation several network layers that cooperate to provide end-to-end communication.

```
    NETWORK LAYER (network.py)
    DATA LINK LAYER (link.py)
```

The code also includes `simulation.py` that manages the threads running the different network objects.
Currently, `simulation.py` defines the following network.

<!-- <img src="images/simple.png" alt="Drawing" style="width:400pt; height:100pt"/> -->

At a high level a network defined in `simulation.py` includes hosts, routers and links. 
`Hosts` generate and receive traffic. 
`Routers` forward traffic from one `Interface` to another based on routing tables that you will implement. 
`Routers` also exchange routing tables to establish forwarding paths.
`Links` connect network interfaces of routers and hosts. 
Finally, the `LinkLayer` forwards traffic along links. 
Please consult the [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsB5zJLCU2k) for a more in-depth explanation of the code.

### Program Invocation

To run the starting code you may execute:

```
    python simulation.py
```

The current `simulation_time` in `simulation.py` is one second. As the network becomes more complex and takes longer to execute, you may need to extend the simulation to allow all the packets to be transferred.


## Assignment

1. [2 points] In the starting code the routing table is an empty dictionary.
	Set up the routing table based on the `cost_D` parameter of the `Router` constructor.
	The implement a _'pretty'_ print of the routing table in `Router.print_routes()` to show a routing table as follows:

	```
	╒══════╤══════╤══════╤══════╤══════╕
	│ RA   │   H1 │   H2 │   RA │   RB │
	╞══════╪══════╪══════╪══════╪══════╡
	│ RA   │    1 │    4 │    0 │    1 │
	├──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤
	│ RB   │    2 │    3 │    1 │    0 │
	╘══════╧══════╧══════╧══════╧══════╛
 	```  
 	
	where the top left corner represents the router from which this tables was printed, the rest of the top row represents the different destinations in the network, the rest of the left column represents paths through known routers, and the numbers represent path costs. 
	In other words the way to read this table is (assume column row indexing): router `RA`(0,0) knows that the cost to destination `H2`(2,0) through router `RB`(0,2) is `3`(2,2).
 	This table corresponds to what the final routing table should be for `RA` in the above network.

 	Getting this pretty print to work will be invaluable to you in debugging your routing protocol implementation.


2. [2 points] Currently `Router.send_routes()` does not send route updates correctly. 
Modify that function to send out route updates as defined in the distance-vector protocol discussed in class and your textbook. 
You will need to come up with a message that encodes the state of your routing tables. 


3. [6 points] Currently `Router.update_routes()` does not update routes correctly. 
Modify that function to update the routing tables using the  Bellman-Ford equation based on updates from `Router.send_routes()`. 
Be aware that receiving an update may mean that you will need to send an update as well!


Submit a YouTube video link showing the execution of `simulation.py` until routing tables converge.
	We will grade you based on the formatting routing tables, the content of your route update messages, and the final state of your routing tables.
	Make sure that all of these are clearly visible in your output.
	Submit your code as `link_1.py`, `network_1.py`, and `simulation_1.py`.


4. [6 points] Currently `Router.forward_packet` always forwards packets on interface `1`.
	Modify that function to forward packets according to the routing tables.

5. [4 points] Modify `simulation.py` to have `Host 2` send a reply packet on the reverse route to `Host 1`


Submit a YouTube video link showing the execution of `simulation.py` forwarding packets between the hosts.
We will grade you based on correct use of the routing tables.
Make sure your output shows the forwarding decisions made by routers.
Submit your code as `link_2.py`, `network_2.py`, and `simulation_2.py`.



6. [10 points] The current router implementation supports a very simple topology.

	Configure `simulation.py` to reflect the following network topology.

	![image](images/complex.png) 

	Now change the link costs in that network such that packets from `Host 1` to `Host 2` follow a different path than packets from `Host 2` to `Host 1.`

Submit a YouTube video link showing the execution of `simulation.py` forwarding packets between the hosts on two different paths.
Make sure your output shows the final routing tables and the forwarding decisions made by routers.
Also submit your code for this scenario as `link_3.py`, `network_3.py`, and `simulation_3.py`.


7. [1 point] BONUS: Extend the code to support IP addressing both for the hosts and router interfaces. You will need to modify the output so that we can see addresses on both the hosts and the router interfaces as they forward the packets.

Submit a YouTube video link showing your output from `simulation.py`.
Submit `link_4.py`, `network_4.py`, and `simulation_4.py`.

8. [1 point] BONUS: Implement IP multicast among a group of three hosts

Submit a YouTube video link showing your output from `simulation.py`. 
Submit `link_5.py`, `network_5.py`, and `simulation_5.py`.
